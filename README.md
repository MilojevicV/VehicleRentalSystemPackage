# VehicleRentalSystemPackage
 CLI application that calculates rental costs based on specific parameters
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 NOTE:
 - Every class is separated in different files and the main function is in the VehicleRentalSystem class.
 - App doesn't require any input as specified by business rules, so everything is already initialized in the main function.
 - Folder is called "VehicleRentalSystemPackage" because my main class was already called "VehicleRentalSystem" in time of creating it.
 - I also added some exceptions to make sure everything is done correctly. I know this wasn't in the rules, but doesn't hurt... Hopefully...
 - Hopefully I followed the business rules correctly and everything is done according to standards.
